                The first step in my journey was an attempt to learn forntend on my own. It was going well, but I didn't feel confident enough to try to get to work. However, I heard about the Codecool programming school and decided to give it a try.

                The first step in learning at school was the basics of python. How to put it? I was doing badly. If it wasn't for the mentors' support, I would give up this school. It was very difficult for me to switch to writing programs displayed in the terminal.

                The end of the python module was an exam that I managed to pass and it gave me confidence in myself that I risked the next step, went to the java module, OOP, very difficult, but also satisfying, interesting and developing. It was very difficult to pass the exam, I put a lot of effort into studying and it paid off with another "win".

                Now I am starting the third module, WEB, which result is this website - my first web project.
